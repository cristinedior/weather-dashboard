# BCS Week 6, Weather Dashboard with API Retrieval

## Getting Started

This project involved accessing a third-party API (Open Weather API), and adding my JS functionality to pull it in, and use it to recall the pulled in data from my local storage.

The task was started with doing research on other weather applications, and looking at their consoles and gathering ideas to see how I should proceed. I tried to go as simple as possible with this assignment and just doing the basics of what was asked of me, without getting lost in doing too much in the details.

I experienced some confusion on how to get my site to display Farenheit temps, but finally found the instructions on the Open Weather site on how to use the API Key link to query appropriately! 
Got lots of help from google, mdn, and chatgpt when I was getting stuck on certain functions not calling correctly, or dates not displaying sequentially.

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city


## Issues Created / Solutions

  1. Create index.html
  2. Create style.css
  3. Create js file
  4. Sign up for the Open Weather API, get API Key
  2. Create README.md
  3. Test generating passwords on webpage to verify functions/prompts are working.
  5. Go through html and javascript files to check for redundancies or places where you can condense elements.
  6. Deployment.
